iOS App Development Roadmap with Swift
Tailored for a Senior DeveloperDedication: 2 Hours/Day, 3-4 Months Timeline
This roadmap is designed for a senior developer proficient in multiple programming languages (e.g., .NET, Flutter) to master iOS app development with Swift and SwiftUI. Leveraging your expertise in OOP, async programming, and clean architecture, this condensed 3-4 month plan (~168-224 hours at 2 hours/day) focuses on Swift-specific features, iOS conventions, and production-ready apps. Each phase includes exercises and projects to build a portfolio. Requires a Mac with Xcode (free from the App Store). Generated by Grok on September 13, 2025.
General Tips

Spend ~1 hour on Swift/iOS concepts, ~1 hour on coding/projects.
Track projects on GitHub for portfolio building.
Use Apple's developer docs and WWDC videos for deep dives.
Apply clean architecture (MVVM) early, aligning with your experience.
Consider Amharic localization to reflect prior work.

Phase 1: Swift Proficiency and iOS Fundamentals (Weeks 1-2)
Objectives
Master Swift-specific features (optionals, protocols, extensions, generics) and iOS basics (Xcode, app lifecycle). Your programming experience will accelerate syntax acquisition.
Estimated Time
2 weeks (~28 hours).
Resources

Apple's Swift Programming Language (skim for advanced topics: docs.swift.org).
Hacking with Swift: "Pro Swift" (hackingwithswift.com).
WWDC videos on Swift concurrency (developer.apple.com).

Daily Structure

Days 1-4: Skim Swift syntax (optionals, protocols, generics), code examples (1 hour each).
Days 5-10: Study iOS app lifecycle, Xcode debugging, async/await.

Exercises

Generics: Write a generic function to filter arrays of any type.
Protocols/Extensions: Create a protocol for data models, extend for JSON parsing.
Concurrency: Refactor a function to use async/await for simulated API calls.

Project
JSON Utility (Command-Line): Build a utility in Xcode playground to parse and manipulate JSON data (e.g., mock API response). Use protocols and generics for flexibility. (~1 week)
Phase 2: SwiftUI and MVVM (Weeks 3-5)
Objectives
Master SwiftUI for UI, state management, and MVVM architecture. Your UI experience (e.g., Flutter, React) will aid rapid learning.
Estimated Time
3 weeks (~42 hours).
Resources

Apple's SwiftUI tutorials (developer.apple.com).
Hacking with Swift: 100 Days of SwiftUI (skip beginner sections: hackingwithswift.com).
Swift by Sundell: MVVM in SwiftUI (swiftbysundell.com).

Daily Structure

Days 1-7: Learn SwiftUI views, navigation, state bindings (1 hour), build small UIs (1 hour).
Days 8-14: Implement MVVM, add animations.

Exercises

Views: Build reusable SwiftUI components (e.g., custom buttons, cards).
State/Binding: Create a form with real-time validation using @State and @Binding.
MVVM: Refactor a view to use a ViewModel for data logic.

Project
Note-Taking App: Build with MVVM. Features: Create/edit notes, categorize, use NavigationStack for multi-screen flow, add animations. (~2 weeks, deploy to simulator)
Phase 3: Persistence and Data Management (Weeks 6-8)
Objectives
Implement Core Data, UserDefaults, and file storage. Your data handling experience (e.g., JSON, MySQL) will streamline this phase.
Estimated Time
3 weeks (~42 hours).
Resources

Apple's Core Data docs (developer.apple.com).
Ray Wenderlich: Core Data tutorials (raywenderlich.com).

Daily Structure

Days 1-5: Study Core Data setup, entities, queries (1 hour), code persistence (1 hour).
Days 6-10: Integrate persistence into an app with MVVM.

Exercises

Core Data: Create a "Task" entity, implement CRUD operations.
UserDefaults: Save app settings (e.g., theme), sync across views.
File Storage: Save/export a text file to the device.

Project
Enhanced Note-Taking App: Add Core Data persistence, search functionality, and JSON export to the Note-Taking App. (~1.5 weeks, ensure data persistence)
Phase 4: Networking and APIs (Weeks 9-10)
Objectives
Fetch and display data from APIs using URLSession and async/await. Your networking experience will make this efficient.
Estimated Time
2 weeks (~28 hours).
Resources

Apple's URLSession and Codable docs (developer.apple.com).
Swift by Sundell: Networking with async/await (swiftbysundell.com).

Daily Structure

Days 1-4: Learn URLSession, Codable, error handling.
Days 5-7: Integrate API data into a SwiftUI app.

Exercises

API Call: Fetch data from a public API (e.g., REST Countries), decode JSON.
Error Handling: Display loading states and errors in UI.
Pagination: Implement "load more" for a paginated API.

Project
News Reader App: Fetch articles from NewsAPI (free key). Display in a list with pull-to-refresh and detail views. (~1 week, handle network failures)
Phase 5: Advanced iOS Features and Polish (Weeks 11-13)
Objectives
Add gestures, notifications, accessibility, and modular architecture. Align with your clean architecture experience (e.g., MVVM, CQRS).
Estimated Time
3 weeks (~42 hours).
Resources

Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (developer.apple.com).
WWDC videos on accessibility, gestures (developer.apple.com).

Daily Structure

Days 1-7: Learn one feature (gestures, notifications) per day, integrate into projects.
Days 8-14: Refactor for modularity, add accessibility.

Exercises

Gestures: Add swipe-to-delete and drag gestures to a list.
Notifications: Schedule local notifications based on user actions.
Accessibility: Add VoiceOver support and dynamic type.

Project
Task Manager App: Build with modular MVVM. Features: Task creation, reminders via notifications, drag-and-drop reordering, accessibility. (~2 weeks, split into modules)
Phase 6: Testing, Deployment, and Portfolio (Weeks 14-16)
Objectives
Write tests, optimize performance, deploy to TestFlight/App Store. Your testing/deployment experience will streamline this.
Estimated Time
3 weeks (~42 hours).
